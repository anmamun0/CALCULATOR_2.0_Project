This code is an implementation of a simple calculator GUI using the Tkinter library in Python.

The code creates a window and sets its size and title. It also sets the background color to dark gray.

The main logic of the calculator is implemented in the click() function, which takes a parameter called value. This function is called when any of the numeric or operator buttons is clicked. The function appends the clicked value to a global string variable called result and displays the result on a label in the GUI.

The final_result() function evaluates the expression stored in the result variable and displays the result on the GUI label when the equal button is clicked.

The click_on_dot() function is called when the user clicks on the decimal point button. It checks if a decimal point already exists in the current number entered by the user, and if not, appends the decimal point to the current number.

The all_Clear() function is called when the user clicks on the "AC" button. It resets the result variable to an empty string and clears the GUI label.

The remove_click() function is called when the user clicks on the backspace button. It removes the last character from the result variable and updates the GUI label.

The buttons are created using the Button() method of Tkinter, and their properties like background color, font, size, and command function are set as parameters.

Finally, the buttons are packed into frames, and the frames are aligned at the bottom of the window using the pack() method of Tkinter.
